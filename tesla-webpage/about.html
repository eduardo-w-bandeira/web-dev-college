            <img src="TeslaLogo.jpg" alt="Tesla Motors logo">
            <p> Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The
                company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a
                $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder. He became CEO in 2008.
                Tesla's announced mission is to create products which help “accelerate the world's transition to
                sustainable energy.”</p>
